# Outlier Detection for Health-Hub Data

These scripts can be used to train and predict outliers for within the data generated by the Health-Hub project.

## Dependencies

Install following dependencies (e.g. with `pip install`)

* scikit-learn
* numpy

# Data Structure
List needs to be structured as: `[pulse data, the GSR level and the temperature]`

## Training a Model
The model can be trained by passing a list of historical data to the `train_norm.py` script. The scripts needs **at least 12 entries** to train a meaningful model.

`python train_norm.py -l "[[120, 1, 36.4], [110, 2, 36.9], [125, 1, 36.3], [115, 3, 36.2], [120, 1, 36.4],[110, 2, 36.9], [122, 2, 36.93], [110, 2, 36.9], [125, 1, 36.3],[115, 3, 36.2], [125, 1, 37.3], [125, 1, 36.7], [125, 1, 37.3], [120, 1, 36.4], [110, 2, 36.2]]"` 

# Predict Outliers
To predict outliers pass a data element to `predict_norm.py`. You need to execute `train_model.py` at least once to be able to make predictions!

`python predict_norm.py -l "[120, 1, 37.3]"`

The scripts returns `[-1]` for outliers and `[1]` for inliers.

# Generated Data
The `train_norm.py` script creates two pickle files: model.pickle and preprocessor.pickle. Theses files are needed by the `predict_norm.py` script.
